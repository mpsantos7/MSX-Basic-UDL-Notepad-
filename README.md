MSX Basic UDL for Notepad++

This is to use to MSX community as a tool in BASIC programmation.   

All key words of MSX Basic until 3.0 (MSX 2+) are included and a simple folding rule to the loop for-next, then you can use auto-completation and color sintax.  

The follow step is to load the basic program in openMSX by mounting a directory as disk or using Catapult text tool entry.
